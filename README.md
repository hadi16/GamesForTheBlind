Rules 
The goal of Sudoku is to fill up the missing numbers on the board so that no number is repeated in each block, row, and column. 
 
**4x4 Board:** A 4x4 Sudoku board is broken into four blocks. Each block contains four squares for numbers to be placed. The squares will be filled in with the numbers 1-4 such that no number is repeated in each block, row, and column. 
 
**6x6 Board:** A 6x6 Sudoku board is somewhat different. The board is broken into six rectangles, each with six squares for numbers to be placed. Each block has two rows and 3 columns of squares to place the numbers 1-6. The squares are arranged so that there are two columns and three rows of squares on the board. 
 
**9x9 Board:** A 9x9 Sudoku board is broken into nine blocks. Each block contains squares for numbers to be placed. The squares must be filled with the numbers 1-9 such that no number is repeated twice in each block, row, and column. 
 
**Playing Instructions** 
 
**How to Play Sudoku Using Mouse:** Simply click on the square where you would like to place a number and press the corresponding number on the number pad. 
 
**How to Play Sudoku Using Keyboard:** For a 4x4 board, imagine the ‘X’, ‘C’, ‘S,’ and ‘D’ keys as the board with each key as a square. Once one of those keys is pressed, imagine those same keys as the squares where each number will be placed. To check if a space is empty or determine which number is in each square, simply press the key again to hear the number or that the square is blank. If the square is empty, no number will be read. Press the desired key and then press the number that you think belongs there. If the number is correct, it will be placed in the square. If the number is incorrect, that space will remain empty. To return the board to its default, zoomed-out position, press the space bar.  
 
To play with a 6x6 or a 9x9 board, repeat these same instructions with the following modifications: 
* For the 6x6 board, use the ‘S’, ‘D’, ‘F’, ‘X’, ‘C,’ and V’ keys. 
* For the 9x9 board, use the ‘W’, ‘E’, ‘R’, ‘S,’ ‘D’, ‘F’, ‘X’, ‘C’, and ‘V’ keys.

5. If this placement is correct, there will be audio feedback that acknowledges that the number 3 was placed correctly. 
6. Press the space bar to return to the fully zoomed-out position.
